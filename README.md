# Banking Marketing Campaign Data Analysis
## Overview

This project aims to optimize marketing strategies for increasing term deposit subscriptions using a dataset containing banking marketing campaign data. Term deposits are financial products offered by banks or financial institutions, providing customers with a fixed interest rate and returning their deposited funds at a specified maturity date. By analyzing the dataset, the goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and interactions with marketing campaigns to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the outcome of marketing campaigns, specifically whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (Yes or No).
Dataset Features

The dataset encompasses various attributes providing insights into customers and their interactions with banking services:

-    Age: The age of the customer.
-    Job: The occupation or employment status of the customer.
-    Marital: The marital status of the customer (e.g., married, single, divorced).
-    Education: The educational background of the customer.
-    Default: Indicates whether the customer has credit in default (yes/no).
-    Balance: The account balance of the customer.
-    Housing: Indicates whether the customer has a housing loan (yes/no).
-    Loan: Indicates whether the customer has a personal loan (yes/no).
-    Contact: The communication method used to contact the customer (e.g., cellular, telephone).
-    Day: The day of the month when the customer was last contacted.
-    Month: The month when the customer was last contacted.
-    Duration: The duration of the last contact with the customer (in seconds).
-    Campaign: The number of contacts performed during this campaign for this customer.
-    Pdays: The number of days that passed since the customer was last contacted from a previous campaign (-1 means not previously contacted).
-    Previous: The number of contacts performed before this campaign for this customer.
-    Poutcome: The outcome of the previous marketing campaign.
-    Deposit: Indicates whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no).

## Objective

The primary objective is to analyze the dataset to understand customer behavior and interactions with marketing campaigns. Subsequently, a deep learning model will be developed to predict the outcome of marketing campaigns, specifically whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. This predictive model will assist in optimizing marketing strategies to increase term deposit subscriptions.
